# Set 1

Hello! At Amazon, you may come across codebases that you're not familiar with, written in languages that you've not necessarily worked with before. The purpose of this task is to test your flexibility with code you've not written, using the existing documentation.

Follow this four step process, to excecute this task. Good luck!

## Check in

* Star the repository: ```https://github.com/test123/Python-Application-Gui```.

## Setup

* Fork the repository ```https://github.com/test123/Python-Application-Gui```
* Create a new **PRIVATE** repository, called ```File-Explorer-Gui```.
* Duplicate the fork into the new private repository.  
[Duplicating a Repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository)



## Task
* Clone your ```File-Explorer-Gui``` to your laptop/desktop, and start working.
* You need to make a desktop application with front-end as HTML/CSS/JS, and backend as Python. Use the existing code to get you started.
* Requirements: When a Folder Path is passed as a command line argument, the contents of that directory get listed in the front end.

## Submission

* Add ```test123``` as a contributer to the ```File-Explorer-Gui``` repository. Make sure you do this, once you're satisfied with your code.
* What to do after adding ```test123``` as a collaborator? Nothing! Just wait for us to evaluate. :)
* The time this account has been added as a contributer will be the time of submission.
* Make sure the submission is done before 3pm **IST**, else it will not be counted.
* The commit stack will be logged at the time of submission, and any changes made to the repository, after submission, will result in disqualification.
* Even if you have only partially completed the task, feel free to submit, because the evaluation will be completely relative.

## Watch out for

* Make sure the repository you create is **Private**.
* Any code changes made in Public repositories will result in instant disqualification.
